                    Chihuahuas are the smallest breed recognized by 
                    some kennel clubs. Current breed standards 
                    defined by registries specify an "apple-head" or 
                    "apple-dome" skull conformation. Chihuahuas occur 
                    in virtually any color combination, from solid to marked or 
                    splashed. Apple-dome Chihuahuas have large, round eyes 
                    and large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded 
                    skull. The stop is well defined, forming a near-90-degree 
                    angle where the muzzle meets the skull.
