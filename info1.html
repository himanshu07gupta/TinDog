            Chihuahuas are the smallest breed recognized by some kennel
            clubs. Current breed standards defined by registries specify an
            "apple-head" or "apple-dome" skull conformation. Chihuahuas
            occur in virtually any color combination, from solid to marked or
            splashed. Apple-dome Chihuahuas have large, round eyes and
            large, erect ears, set in a high, dramatically rounded skull.
            The stop is well defined, forming a near-90-degree angle where the
            muzzle meets the skull.
